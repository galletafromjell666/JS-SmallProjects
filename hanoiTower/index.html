      <h1>Hanoi Tower using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS</h1>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>
        The Towers of Hanoi is an ancient puzzle played with three stacks and
        any number of differently-sized disks. At the start, all the disks are
        in the leftmost stack, with the largest disk on the bottom and the
        smallest on the top. The object is to get all the disks over to the
        rightmost stack. You can only move one disk per move, and you can only
        move the top disk on a stack. The top disk of any stack can be moved to
        the top disk of any other stack, with the restriction that you can't
        move a larger disk on top of a smaller disk -- i.e., disks can only be
        moved to empty stacks or on top of larger disks. To move a disk, click
        on it. (If you can't click on a disk, it means you can't legally move it
        anywhere.) If there is only one place the disk can be moved to, it will
        be moved there automatically; otherwise, you'll have to click on a stack
        to move it to.
